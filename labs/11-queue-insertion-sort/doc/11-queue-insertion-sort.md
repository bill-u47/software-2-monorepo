## Objective

In this lab you will implement and test the Queue sort secondary method using
the insertion sort algorithm. You will also familiarize yourself with an
implementation of the SortingMachine kernel using the same implementation of
insertInOrder.

## Method

1. First carefully look through the file QueueSortMain.java, which is a test
   driver for a `Queue1LSort3<T>` extension for `Queue1L<T>`, to get an idea of
   the overall structure and to see what the main method does. In particular,
   note the declaration of the StringLT _nested_ class that provides an
   implementation for the `Comparator<String>` interface using the
   [lexicographic order][Lexicographic Order] for Strings, and its use in the
   main method.
2. In Queue1LSort3.java, complete the body of the insertInOrder static method
   and the body of the sort instance method with the code you wrote for your
   homework.
3. Run the QueueSortMain test program. You can use the lines.txt file in the
   data folder in your project as a test input. Fix any problems you discover.
4. Once you are confident that your implementation of insertion sort works,
   open the SortingMachine3.java file. This is a skeleton for an implementation
   of SortingMachine kernel. Look through the file carefully and follow these
   steps.
    - In the "Private members" section, note the representation which includes
      three instance variables (or fields): a **boolean** insertionMode to keep
      track of the machine mode (insertion or extraction), a `Comparator<T>`
      machineOrder that records the ordering used to sort, and a `Queue<T>`
      entries to keep track of the entries in the machine.
    - Find the createNewRep method and note how it initializes the
      representation fields.
    - Fill in the body of the private method insertInOrder by copying and
      pasting your code from the previous part of the lab. It should not require
      any changes.
    - Find the "Kernel methods" section and fill in the bodies of the six kernel
      methods following the comments provided. _Each of these methods can be
      implemented with a single line of code._
5. Back in the QueueSortMain test program, update the main program so that it
   sorts the input from the file using your SortingMachine3 implementation.
   This requires just a few changes. If you are not sure, you should look at
   [Slides 49-50 in SortingMachine][Slides 49-50 in SortingMachine]. Run your
   program again and make sure the output is correct. If not, find the bug(s)
   and fix them.

## Additional Activities

1. In the test folder, open SortingMachineTest.java and carefully review the
   code provided. In particular, note the StringLT implementation of
   `Comparator<String>`, the variable ORDER, and how it is used in the two
   sample test cases provided. Add test cases to test the kernel methods of
   SortingMachine. Run your JUnit test fixture and fix any problems that come
   up.
