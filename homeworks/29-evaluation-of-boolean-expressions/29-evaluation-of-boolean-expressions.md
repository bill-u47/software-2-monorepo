## Problems

The following problems will give you practice with statements and recursion.

### Problem 1

> Consider the following grammar for Boolean expressions.
>
>       bool-expr	→ T |
>                   → F |
>                   → NOT ( bool-expr ) |
>                   → ( bool-expr binary-op bool-expr )
>       binary-op	→ AND | OR
>
> The recursive descent parser to evaluate syntactically valid
> Boolean expressions has a single method corresponding to the
> bool-expr start symbol of this grammar. A tokenizer is used to
> convert the input into a queue of tokens (Queue<String>) given
> as the argument to the parser. The tokenizer takes care of the
> binary-op non-terminal symbol by returning "AND" and "OR" as single
> tokens. You can assume that the input is syntactically valid, so
> that no error checking is necessary. Here is a sample value for
> #tokens. It represents a a boolean expression whose parse tree
> only has height 3. Other incoming values can be more complicated.
> Note that, as terminal symbols, parentheses can be part of a boolean
> expression. The given sample value represents the boolean expression:
>
>       NOT ( F )
>
> A possible sample value promised for #tokens could be:
>
>       <"NOT", "(", "F", ")", "### END OF INPUT ###">
>
> In this case the outgoing value of tokens should be:
>
>       <"### END OF INPUT ###">
>
> Do not test for equality against "### END OF INPUT ###"
> or test against the length of tokens. Another sample value for
> the same boolean expression could be:
>
>       <"NOT", "(", "F", ")", ")", "### END OF INPUT ###">
>
> In this latter case the outgoing value of tokens should be:
>
>       <")", "### END OF INPUT ###">
>
> Finally, yet another sample value for the same boolean expression could be:
>
>       <"NOT", "(", "F", ")">
>
> In this last case the outgoing value of tokens should be:
>
>       <>
>
> Write the code for the following method making sure you use the
> grammar above as a guide (as discussed in class and in Recursive-Descent Parsing).

```java
/**
 * Evaluates a Boolean expression and returns its value.
 *
 * @param tokens
 *            the {@code Queue<String>} that starts with a bool-expr string
 * @return value of the expression
 * @updates tokens
 * @requires [a bool-expr string is a prefix of tokens]
 * @ensures <pre>
 * valueOfBoolExpr =
 *   [value of longest bool-expr string at start of #tokens]  and
 * #tokens = [longest bool-expr string at start of #tokens] * tokens
 * </pre>
 */
public static boolean valueOfBoolExpr(Queue<String> tokens) {...}
```

> As practice for the final exam (recursive-descent parsers will not be
> a topic for the upcoming second midterm exam), you should first write the
> code without any assistance from Eclipse. However, if you would like to
> test your code, you can paste it in this BooleanExpressionEvaluator.java
> skeleton file. You may also want to develop a JUnit test fixture to test
> your parser as extra practice. For this homework, just turn in a print-out
> of the code for valueOfBoolExpr.

## Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, VS Code should
automatically convert the template to a PDF on save. If you're not automatically
getting a PDF, please reach out to the instructor. If you're in a rush to
submit, you may use one of the alternative strategies described in this
[Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. You may also consider printing
the raw markdown directly. However, do not make a habit of this as the graders
reserve the right to give a zero.
