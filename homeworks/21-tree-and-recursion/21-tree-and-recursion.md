## Problems

The following problems will give you practice with trees and recursion.

### Problem 1

> Write a recursive body for the following static, generic
> method that computes and returns the size of a given Tree<T>.
> You can use any of the Tree methods except for the iterator
> and the size kernel method. Note that the Tree must be restored,
> i.e., its outgoing value must be the same as its incoming value.

```java
/**
 * Returns the size of the given {@code Tree<T>}.
 *
 * @param <T>
 *            the type of the {@code Tree} node labels
 * @param t
 *            the {@code Tree} whose size to return
 * @return the size of the given {@code Tree}
 * @ensures size = |t|
 */
public static <T> int size(Tree<T> t) {...}
```

### Problem 2

> Provide a second implementation of the size method above but
> this time make it an iterative (non-recursive) solution. You
> still cannot use the size kernel method in your solution.

### Problem 3

> Write a recursive body for the following static, generic method
> that computes and returns the height of a given Tree<T>. You
> can use any of the Tree methods except for the height kernel
> method (in particular, you can use the size method). Note that
> the Tree must be restored, i.e., its outgoing value must be the
> same as its incoming value.

```java
/**
 * Returns the height of the given {@code Tree<T>}.
 *
 * @param <T>
 *            the type of the {@code Tree} node labels
 * @param t
 *            the {@code Tree} whose height to return
 * @return the height of the given {@code Tree}
 * @ensures height = ht(t)
 */
public static <T> int height(Tree<T> t) {...}
```

### Problem 4

> Write a recursive body for the following static method that computes
> and returns the largest integer in a given non-empty Tree<Integer>.
> Note that the Tree must be restored, i.e., its outgoing value must
> be the same as its incoming value.

```java
/**
 * Returns the largest integer in the given {@code Tree<Integer>}.
 *
 * @param t
 *            the {@code Tree<Integer>} whose largest integer to return
 * @return the largest integer in the given {@code Tree<Integer>}
 * @requires |t| > 0
 * @ensures <pre>
 * max is in labels(t)  and
 * for all i: integer where (i is in labels(t)) (i <= max)
 * </pre>
 */
public static int max(Tree<Integer> t) {...}
```

## Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, VS Code should
automatically convert the template to a PDF on save. If you're not automatically
getting a PDF, please reach out to the instructor. If you're in a rush to
submit, you may use one of the alternative strategies described in this
[Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. You may also consider printing
the raw markdown directly. However, do not make a habit of this as the graders
reserve the right to give a zero.
