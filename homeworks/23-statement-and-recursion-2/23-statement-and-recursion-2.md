## Problems

The following problems will give you practice with statements and recursion.

### Problem 1

> Using recursion, complete the body of the following static method.

```java
/**
 * Refactors the given {@code Statement} so that every IF_ELSE statement
 * with a negated condition (NEXT_IS_NOT_EMPTY, NEXT_IS_NOT_ENEMY,
 * NEXT_IS_NOT_FRIEND, NEXT_IS_NOT_WALL) is replaced by an equivalent
 * IF_ELSE with the opposite condition and the "then" and "else" BLOCKs
 * switched. Every other statement is left unmodified.
 *
 * @param s
 *            the {@code Statement}
 * @updates s
 * @ensures <pre>
 * s = [#s refactored so that IF_ELSE statements with "not"
 *   conditions are simplified so the "not" is removed]
 * </pre>
 */
public static void simplifyIfElse(Statement s) {
    switch (s.kind()) {
        case BLOCK: {
 
            // TODO - fill in case
 
            break;
        }
        case IF: {
 
            // TODO - fill in case
 
            break;
        }
        case IF_ELSE: {
 
            // TODO - fill in case
 
            break;
        }
        case WHILE: {
 
            // TODO - fill in case
 
            break;
        }
        case CALL: {
            // nothing to do here...can you explain why?
            break;
        }
        default: {
            // this will never happen...can you explain why?
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

## Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, VS Code should
automatically convert the template to a PDF on save. If you're not automatically
getting a PDF, please reach out to the instructor. If you're in a rush to
submit, you may use one of the alternative strategies described in this
[Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. You may also consider printing
the raw markdown directly. However, do not make a habit of this as the graders
reserve the right to give a zero.
