## Problems

**This homework is necessary preparation for the lab.** Make sure you
type your answers in files you bring to the lab so that you will not
have to waste time entering your code during the lab.

### Problem 1

> Write a recursive body for the following static, generic method
> that computes and returns the size of a given BinaryTree<T>.
> You can use any of the BinaryTree methods except for the iterator
> and the size kernel method. Note that the BinaryTree must be
> restored, i.e., its outgoing value must be the same as its incoming
> value.

```java
/**
 * Returns the size of the given {@code BinaryTree<T>}.
 *
 * @param <T>
 *            the type of the {@code BinaryTree} node labels
 * @param t
 *            the {@code BinaryTree} whose size to return
 * @return the size of the given {@code BinaryTree}
 * @ensures size = |t|
 */
public static <T> int size(BinaryTree<T> t) {...}
```

### Problem 2

> Provide a second implementation of the size method above but
> this time make it an iterative (non-recursive) solution. You
> cannot use the size kernel method in your solution.

```java
/**
 * Returns the size of the given {@code BinaryTree<T>}.
 *
 * @param <T>
 *            the type of the {@code BinaryTree} node labels
 * @param t
 *            the {@code BinaryTree} whose size to return
 * @return the size of the given {@code BinaryTree}
 * @ensures size = |t|
 */
public static <T> int size(BinaryTree<T> t) {...}
```

## Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, VS Code should
automatically convert the template to a PDF on save. If you're not automatically
getting a PDF, please reach out to the instructor. If you're in a rush to
submit, you may use one of the alternative strategies described in this
[Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. You may also consider printing
the raw markdown directly. However, do not make a habit of this as the graders
reserve the right to give a zero.
