## Problems

**This homework is necessary preparation for the lab.** Make sure you
type your answers in files you bring to the lab so that you will not
have to waste time entering your code during the lab.

### Problem 1

> Implement the following method that, given a queue of Map.Pair<K, V>
> and a key of type K, searches for a pair with the given key in the
> given queue and, if it finds it, moves that pair to the front of the
> queue.

```java
/**
 * Finds pair with first component {@code key} and, if such exists, moves it
 * to the front of {@code q}.
 *
 * @param <K>
 *            type of {@code Pair} key
 * @param <V>
 *            type of {@code Pair} value
 * @param q
 *            the {@code Queue} to be searched
 * @param key
 *            the key to be searched for
 * @updates q
 * @ensures <pre>
 * perms(q, #q)  and
 * if there exists value: V (<(key, value)> is substring of q)
 *  then there exists value: V (<(key, value)> is prefix of q)
 * </pre>
 */
private static <K, V> void moveToFront(Queue<Pair<K, V>> q, K key) {...}
```

> Note that moveToFront is a static, generic method: it is parameterized
> by the types K and V of the Map.Pair<K, V> entries in the queue. You can
> use the types K, V, and Pair<K, V> wherever you need to declare a variable
> that refers to an object of any of these types.
>
> Pay attention to the contract. There is no requires clause. If you have
> trouble reading and understanding the ensures clause, be sure to ask for help.
>
> If you need to construct a Pair object in your code (it should not be necessary
> in moveToFront, but you will need it in the lab), just use the only available
> implementation of the Map.Pair interface called MapSecondary.SimplePair<K, V>.
> Inside the Map2 class, you will be able to declare and initialize a Pair
> variable with a statement like this:

```java
Pair<K, V> p = new SimplePair<>(key, value);
```

> where key and value are some variables of type K and V, respectively.

### Problem 2

> Develop a complete test plan for the Map constructor and kernel methods:
> add, remove, removeAny, value, hasKey, and size and enter them in [MapTest][map-test].

### Problem 3

> Complete (and print with your homework) the following tracing table.
> We care greatly that you use correct punctuation when you write objects'
> values; we care so much that we will dock you points on exams when you
> use wrong punctuation when supplying objects' values to our questions.
> We urge you to practice writing correctly the values of objects. For
> example, after the 4th statement one of the six correct ways of showing
> this value is: m = {("zero", 0), ("negative one", -1), ("one", 1)}. There are
> six (or three factorial, 3!) correct ways because the order in which we
> show the three elements of the set does not matter. Note the use of curly
> braces, rounded parentheses, commas, double quote marks, and the absence
> thereof. As another example, after the 5th statement the only correct value
> for p is: p = ("zero", 0). It is a good idea to consult the mathematical
> models for MapKernel and Map.Pair and make a connection between them and
> the notation used in the correct answers shown here just above. Of course,
> it is also a good idea to consult the contract for each method or constructor
> called.

## Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, VS Code should
automatically convert the template to a PDF on save. If you're not automatically
getting a PDF, please reach out to the instructor. If you're in a rush to
submit, you may use one of the alternative strategies described in this
[Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. You may also consider printing
the raw markdown directly. However, do not make a habit of this as the graders
reserve the right to give a zero.
