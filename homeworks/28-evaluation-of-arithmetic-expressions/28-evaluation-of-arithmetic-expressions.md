your own feedback][feedback-form] after completing this assignment.

## Problems

**This homework is necessary preparation for the lab.** Make sure you
type your answers in files you bring to the lab so that you will not
have to waste time entering your code during the lab.

### Problem 1

> Consider the following grammar for arithmetic expressions.
> It is similar to the one discussed in class.
>
>       expr        → term { + term | - term }
>       term        → factor { * factor | / factor }
>       factor      → ( expr ) | digit-seq
>       digit-seq   → digit { digit }
>       digit       → 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
>
> The recursive descent parser to evaluate syntactically valid arithmetic
> expressions has five methods corresponding to each of the five non-terminal
> symbols of this grammar. A tokenizer is not used for this parser. Instead,
> each method gets input characters from a StringBuilder parameter called source.
> You can assume that the source argument does not contain any white space or any
> other characters not part of the expression except for at least one "sentinel"
> character after the end of the expression to mark the end. In other words, any
> proper prefix of the argument can contain only characters from the set
> {'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '(', ')', '+', '-', '*', '/'}.
> You can further assume that the input is syntactically valid, so that no error
> checking is necessary.
>
> Here are few more hints:
>
> - A string s1 being a proper prefix of a string s2 means both that the
>   length of s1 is strictly less than (less than but not equal to) the length
>   of s2 and that s1 is a prefix of s2.
> - The instance methods charAt(int) and deleteCharAt(int) defined in StringBuilder
>   will be useful to manipulate the input.
> - The static methods isDigit(char) and digit(char, int) in class Character can be
>   used to check if a character is a digit and to convert a digit character into the
>   corresponding integer value, respectively.
>
> Write the code for the following 5 methods making sure you use the grammar above
> as a guide (as discussed in class and in Recursive-Descent Parsing).

## Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, VS Code should
automatically convert the template to a PDF on save. If you're not automatically
getting a PDF, please reach out to the instructor. If you're in a rush to
submit, you may use one of the alternative strategies described in this
[Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. You may also consider printing
the raw markdown directly. However, do not make a habit of this as the graders
reserve the right to give a zero.
