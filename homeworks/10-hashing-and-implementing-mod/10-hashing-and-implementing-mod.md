## Problems

**This homework is necessary preparation for the lab.** Make sure you
type your answers in files you bring to the lab so that you will not
have to waste time entering your code during the lab.

### Problem 1

> Provide an implementation for the following static method mod that
> computes the modulo function using "clock arithmetic".

```java
/**
 * Computes {@code a} mod {@code b} as % should have been defined to work.
 *
 * @param a
 *            the number being reduced
 * @param b
 *            the modulus
 * @return the result of a mod b, which satisfies 0 <= {@code mod} < b
 * @requires b > 0
 * @ensures <pre>
 * 0 <= mod  and  mod < b  and
 * there exists k: integer (a = k * b + mod)
 * </pre>
 */
public static int mod(int a, int b) {...}
```

> Note that, although you can use the remainder operator % in your
> solution, the following is not a correct implementation.

```java
public static int mod(int a, int b) {
    return a % b;
}
```

> If you are not sure why not, see the CSE 2221 lab where this was
> discussed (Sections 3. Debugging Oddity and Additional Activities).

### Problem 2

> Consider the set of integer {432, 17, 54, –788, –101, 84, 0, –6, –195, 90}
> and a hash table of size 10. Answer the following questions.

#### Problem 2A

> There are many implementations of hashCode that might seem reasonable
> when the argument type is Integer. For example, if you don't know anything
> in advance about the Integer values that might be likely to be hashed,
> then the implementation for hashCode that just returns the integer itself
> is quite reasonable (and, as it happens, this is the actual implementation
> provided by java.lang.Integer in the standard Java library). Show how the
> elements of the set above are distributed among the buckets by this hash
> function.

| Bucket | Integers Hashed |
| ------ | --------------- |
| 0      |                 |
| 1      |                 |
| 2      |                 |
| 3      |                 |
| 4      |                 |
| 5      |                 |
| 6      |                 |
| 7      |                 |
| 8      |                 |
| 9      |                 |

#### Problem 2B

> Write any qualitatively different implementation of hashCode when the
> argument type is Integer that might seem "reasonable" (without thinking
> in advance about the particular elements of the set above). Then show
> how the elements of the set above are distributed among the buckets by
> this hash function.

| Bucket | Integers Hashed |
| ------ | --------------- |
| 0      |                 |
| 1      |                 |
| 2      |                 |
| 3      |                 |
| 4      |                 |
| 5      |                 |
| 6      |                 |
| 7      |                 |
| 8      |                 |
| 9      |                 |

## Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, VS Code should
automatically convert the template to a PDF on save. If you're not automatically
getting a PDF, please reach out to the instructor. If you're in a rush to
submit, you may use one of the alternative strategies described in this
[Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. You may also consider printing
the raw markdown directly. However, do not make a habit of this as the graders
reserve the right to give a zero.
