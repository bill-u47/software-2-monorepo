## Problems

**This homework is necessary preparation for the lab.** Make sure you
type your answers in files you bring to the lab so that you will not
have to waste time entering your code during the lab.

### Problem 1

> Carefully review the Queue2 implementation of Queue kernel represented
> as a singly-linked list of Nodes. In particular, look at the representation
> fields (and the convention and correspondence) and the code in createNewRep
> and the constructor, and draw a picture (in the style used in the Linked Data
> Structures slides) of the Queue2 representation right after the constructor
> is executed.

### Problem 2

> Carefully review the Stack2 skeleton of Stack kernel represented as a
> singly-linked list of Nodes. In particular, look at the representation fields
> and the convention and correspondence, and draw a picture (in the style used
> in the Linked Data Structures slides) of the representation a Stack2 object
> should have right after the constructor is executed.

### Problem 3

> Complete the implementation of the Stack kernel represented as a singly-linked
> list of Nodes in the skeleton provided, Stack2. You need to write bodies for
> the private method createNewRep and for the kernel methods push, pop, and length.
>
> Note that although the Stack2 implementation is similar to the Queue2 implementation,
> there are two significant differences: (1) the Queue2 representation has three
> fields (instance variables): preFront, rear, and length, while Stack2 only has two
> fields: top and length; (2) the singly-linked list representing Queue2 has one extra
> "smart" node at the front of the list, while the singly-linked list representing
> Stack2 does not include this extra node.

## Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, VS Code should
automatically convert the template to a PDF on save. If you're not automatically
getting a PDF, please reach out to the instructor. If you're in a rush to
submit, you may use one of the alternative strategies described in this
[Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. You may also consider printing
the raw markdown directly. However, do not make a habit of this as the graders
reserve the right to give a zero.
