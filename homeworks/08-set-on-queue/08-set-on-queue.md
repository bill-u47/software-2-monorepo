## Problems

**This homework is necessary preparation for the lab.** Make sure you
type your answers in files you bring to the lab so that you will not
have to waste time entering your code during the lab.

### Problem 1

> Implement the following method that, given a queue and an
> entry of type T, searches for the given entry in the given
> queue and, if it finds it, moves that entry to the front of
> the queue.

```java
/**
 * Finds {@code x} in {@code q} and, if such exists, moves it to the front
 * of {@code q}.
 *
 * @param <T>
 *            type of {@code Queue} entries
 * @param q
 *            the {@code Queue} to be searched
 * @param x
 *            the entry to be searched for
 * @updates q
 * @ensures <pre>
 * perms(q, #q)  and
 * if <x> is substring of q
 *  then <x> is prefix of q
 * </pre>
 */
private static <T> void moveToFront(Queue<T> q, T x) {...}
```

> Note that moveToFront is a static, generic method: it is parameterized
> by the type T of the entries in the queue. You can use the type T
> wherever you need to declare a variable that refers to an object of
> type T.
>
> Pay attention to the contract. There is no requires clause. If you have
> trouble reading and understanding the *ensures* clause, be sure to ask for
> help.

### Problem 2

> Develop a complete test plan for the Set constructor and kernel methods:
> add, remove, removeAny, contains, and size and enter them in [SetTest][set-test].
> You can find some more information on how to effectively test removeAny
> [here][remove-any].

## Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, VS Code should
automatically convert the template to a PDF on save. If you're not automatically
getting a PDF, please reach out to the instructor. If you're in a rush to
submit, you may use one of the alternative strategies described in this
[Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. You may also consider printing
the raw markdown directly. However, do not make a habit of this as the graders
reserve the right to give a zero.
