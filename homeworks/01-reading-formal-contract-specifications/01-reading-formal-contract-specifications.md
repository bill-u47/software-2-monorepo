## Problems

Below you will find the list of problems for this homework assignment.

### Problem 1

> (Nothing to turn in for this question) Add a recent, clear photo
of yourself to both your Zoom profile and to your Carmen profile.

### Problem 2

> Consider the following contract specification for the static method
> smooth.

```java
/**
 * No informal description here for obvious reasons...
 *
 * @replaces s2
 * @requires |s1| >= 1
 * @ensures <pre>
 * |s2| = |s1| - 1  and
 *  for all i, j: integer, a, b: string of integer
 *      where (s1 = a * <i> * <j> * b)
 *    (there exists c, d: string of integer
 *       (|c| = |a|  and
 *        s2 = c * <(i+j)/2> * d))
 * </pre>
 */
public static void smooth(Sequence<Integer> s1, Sequence<Integer> s2) {...}
```

> Answer the following questions.

#### Problem 2A

> Suppose seq1 = < 2, 4, 6 >, seq2 = < -5, 12 >. What are the values
> of seq1 and seq2 after the call smooth(seq1, seq2)?

#### Problem 2B

> Suppose seq1 = < 7 >, seq2 = < 13, 17, 11 >. What are the values of
> seq1 and seq2 after the call smooth(seq1, seq2)?

<!-- TODO: answer this question -->

#### Problem 2C

> Suppose seq1 = < >, seq2 = < >. What are the values of seq1 and seq2
> after the call smooth(seq1, seq2)?

<!-- TODO: answer this question -->

#### Problem 2D

> Explain informally, but precisely, what the specs of smooth say about
> the method's behavior. In other words, explain in English what smooth
> is supposed to do.

## Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, VS Code should
automatically convert the template to a PDF on save. If you're not automatically
getting a PDF, please reach out to the instructor. If you're in a rush to
submit, you may use one of the alternative strategies described in this
[Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. You may also consider printing
the raw markdown directly. However, do not make a habit of this as the graders
reserve the right to give a zero.
