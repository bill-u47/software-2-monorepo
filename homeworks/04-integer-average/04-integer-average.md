## Problems

Consider the following contract specification for the static method average.
Please note that, both in the specification and in the Java programming
language, the integer-division (' / ') operator's result is obtained by
truncating toward zero. Hence, (-3 / 2) = -1 and (9 / 2) = 4 . It is like
"rounding", except that the quotient given as the result is not necessarily
the closest integer to the correct rational quotient: it is the first-encountered
integer closer to zero than the correct rational quotient.

```java
/**
 * Returns the integer average of two given {@code int}s.
 *
 * @param j
 *            the first of two integers to average
 * @param k
 *            the second of two integers to average
 * @return the integer average of j and k
 * @ensures average = (j+k)/2
 */
public static int average(int j, int k) {...}
```

Answer the following questions.

### Problem 1

> Provide an argument justifying the following claim: The average (as defined here)
> of two Java ints i and j is representable as an int, regardless of the lower and
> upper bounds on the value of an int.

<!-- TODO: answer the question here -->
Regardless of the value of the average, it can always be represented by an integer. The reason being that
(i+j)/2 may produce a decimal point, but that can be rounded to represent the average k as an integer. The int may
be positive, it may be negative, it may be absurdly huge or small, but averages are always able to be represented as an integer
as long as you round (provided there are decimal points).

### Problem 2

> Provide an implementation of the average method with int as the only type you use
> (except, perhaps, for boolean). Note: return (j+k)/2; does not implement the contract
> specification. Some of the test cases shown below will reveal defects in this obvious
> implementation. Your challenge is to figure out a way or ways to work around the fact
> that, if a sum is non-representable as an int (has overflowed), then Java arranges
> that the value provided at run-time is wrong. In other words, each arithmetic operation
> has a precondition that requires that the result is representable in its type. Your
> challenge includes making sure that this precondition is always satisfied. As you find
> ways to do so, you'll also need to work out difficulties involved with the truncating
> going in the wrong direction, as compared with the truncation direction established in
> the contract specification. (By the way, because it is mathematics, the expressions in
> contract specifications always mean the right answer; in contract specifications, there
> is no overflow.) Each of the following is a valid test case for the average method.

|     | j                 | k                     | return                |
| --- | ----------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1   | Integer.MAX_VALUE | Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1 | Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1 | round down, j > k
| 2   | Integer.MIN_VALUE | Integer.MIN_VALUE + 1 | Integer.MIN_VALUE + 1 | round up, j < k
| 3   | Integer.MIN_VALUE | Integer.MIN_VALUE     | Integer.MIN_VALUE     | no round
| 4   | Integer.MAX_VALUE | Integer.MAX_VALUE     | Integer.MAX_VALUE     | no round
| 5   | 5                 | 8                     | 6                     | round down, j < k
| 6   | -5                | -8                    | -6                    | round up, j > k
| 7   | 11                | -4                    | 3                     | round down, j > k
| 8   | -3                | 2                     | 0                     | round up, j < k
| 9   | 3                 | 5                     | 4                     | no round
| 10  | -3                | -5                    | -4                    | no round


## if j > k, round down?
```java
/**
 * Returns the integer average of two given {@code int}s.
 *
 * @param j
 *            the first of two integers to average
 * @param k
 *            the second of two integers to average
 * @return the integer average of j and k
 * @ensures average = (j+k)/2
 */
public static int average(int j, int k) {
    int average = (int)(((long) j + (long) k)/2);
    return average;
}
```

## Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, VS Code should
automatically convert the template to a PDF on save. If you're not automatically
getting a PDF, please reach out to the instructor. If you're in a rush to
submit, you may use one of the alternative strategies described in this
[Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. You may also consider printing
the raw markdown directly. However, do not make a habit of this as the graders
reserve the right to give a zero.
