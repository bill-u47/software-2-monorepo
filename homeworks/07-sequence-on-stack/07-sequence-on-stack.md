## Problems

**This homework is necessary preparation for the lab.** Make sure you
type your answers in files you bring to the lab so that you will not
have to waste time entering your code during the lab.

### Problem 1

> Implement the following method that, given two stacks and an
> integer, moves entries between the two stacks so that the length
> of the first stack is equal to the given integer. Note that, as
> the ensures clause states, rev(leftStack) * rightStack must not
> be changed by the method.

```java
/**
 * Shifts entries between {@code leftStack} and {@code rightStack}, keeping
 * reverse of the former concatenated with the latter fixed, and resulting
 * in length of the former equal to {@code newLeftLength}.
 *
 * @param <T>
 *            type of {@code Stack} entries
 * @param leftStack
 *            the left {@code Stack}
 * @param rightStack
 *            the right {@code Stack}
 * @param newLeftLength
 *            desired new length of {@code leftStack}
 * @updates leftStack, rightStack
 * @requires <pre>
 * 0 <= newLeftLength  and
 * newLeftLength <= |leftStack| + |rightStack|
 * </pre>
 * @ensures <pre>
 * rev(leftStack) * rightStack = rev(#leftStack) * #rightStack  and
 * |leftStack| = newLeftLength}
 * </pre>
 */
private static <T> void setLengthOfLeftStack(Stack<T> leftStack,
        Stack<T> rightStack, int newLeftLength) {...}
```

> Note that setLengthOfLeftStack is a static, generic method:
> it is parameterized by the type T of the entries in the stacks.
> You can use the type T wherever you need to declare a variable
> that refers to an object of type T.

### Problem 2

> Develop a complete test plan for the Sequence constructor
> and kernel methods (add, remove, and length) and enter
> them in [SequenceTest][sequence-test].

<!-- TODO: fill out skeleton below -->

```java
import components.sequence.Sequence;

/**
 * JUnit test fixture for {@code Sequence<String>}'s constructor and kernel
 * methods.
 *
 * @author Put your name here
 *
 */
public abstract class SequenceTest {

    /**
     * Invokes the appropriate {@code Sequence} constructor for the
     * implementation under test and returns the result.
     *
     * @return the new sequence
     * @ensures constructorTest = <>
     */
    protected abstract Sequence<String> constructorTest();

    /**
     * Invokes the appropriate {@code Sequence} constructor for the reference
     * implementation and returns the result.
     *
     * @return the new sequence
     * @ensures constructorRef = <>
     */
    protected abstract Sequence<String> constructorRef();

    /**
     *
     * Creates and returns a {@code Sequence<String>} of the implementation
     * under test type with the given entries.
     *
     * @param args
     *            the entries for the sequence
     * @return the constructed sequence
     * @ensures createFromArgsTest = [entries in args]
     */
    private Sequence<String> createFromArgsTest(String... args) {
        Sequence<String> sequence = this.constructorTest();
        for (String s : args) {
            sequence.add(sequence.length(), s);
        }
        return sequence;
    }

    /**
     *
     * Creates and returns a {@code Sequence<String>} of the reference
     * implementation type with the given entries.
     *
     * @param args
     *            the entries for the sequence
     * @return the constructed sequence
     * @ensures createFromArgsRef = [entries in args]
     */
    private Sequence<String> createFromArgsRef(String... args) {
        Sequence<String> sequence = this.constructorRef();
        for (String s : args) {
            sequence.add(sequence.length(), s);
        }
        return sequence;
    }

    // TODO - add test cases for constructor, add, remove, and length

}
```

## Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, VS Code should
automatically convert the template to a PDF on save. If you're not automatically
getting a PDF, please reach out to the instructor. If you're in a rush to
submit, you may use one of the alternative strategies described in this
[Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. You may also consider printing
the raw markdown directly. However, do not make a habit of this as the graders
reserve the right to give a zero.
